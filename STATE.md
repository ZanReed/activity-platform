# STATE.md

A living "where am I" snapshot. Update at the end of each work session — replace the relevant sections, don't append. Keep it under ~150 lines: move finished-work narratives to [docs/HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md), durable reasoning to [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Project rules live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Pending author actions

Things only the author does (pushes, deploys, migrations), queued and waiting.

**Nothing queued.** All recent deploy trains are author-run + done — details archived in [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md) (2026-07-15 → 07-21 section). Current live state: `ingest-submission` accepts wire **v9**, storage **v12**, **live kit `graph-kit-XB5CUURV.js`** (source of truth: `supabase/functions/_shared/graph-kit-manifest.ts`; older hashes stay on R2 so already-published pages keep working until re-published). Standing reminder: any future `ingest-submission` / `get-feedback` redeploy needs `--no-verify-jwt` (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)).

## Next major arc — STRICT-GRID: COMPLETE (T1–T8) + known-gaps TRIAGED 2026-07-21 (nothing queued)

**Strict-grid editor migration ([docs/design/strict-grid-editor.md](docs/design/strict-grid-editor.md)).** The editor's ProseMirror tree now IS the stored rows-of-columns model (doc `(row|sectionBreak)+`, every block inside a `column`); serialize's collapse/unwrap is deleted. **App-only — NO renderer/publish/wire/storage change** (stored shape unchanged; bundle regen = zero drift). Killed the editor-vs-storage tech debt.

**SLICES 1 + 2 + known-gaps triage — DONE + on `main` (not pushed).** Slice 1 (T1–T6 structural, commits `3d91692`→`bcffebb`): `editor/extensions/Doc.ts` (strict top node, row-first fill), `StrictGridNormalize.ts` (empty-state/trailing-para/re-coalesce, undo-safe), `editor/strictGrid.ts` helpers, `lib/serializeTestBridge.ts`; StarterKit TrailingNode disabled; 1-col rows render FLAT (grip only on multi-col). Slice 2 (T7 seam affordances + T8 import): `RowSeamCaret.ts` keymap (boundary Backspace selects the seam, Arrow crosses it — Playwright-verified), `Columns.ts` `dissolveRow` + `addRowBelow`, toolbar column cluster gated to multi-col + Merge/Row-below escape hatches, and the ` ```columns ``` ` Markdown fence (`parseColumnsFence`, columns split by `---`, 2–6 cols → strict `row`). Known gaps TRIAGED 2026-07-21 (`/plan-eng-review` + `/plan-design-review`, both CLEARED): **B1** grip click-menu BUILT (`gridRowMenu.tsx`/`GridRowMenuHost.tsx`, reuses `dissolveRow`/`addRowBelow`); **B2** build-nothing (dragHandleNested deliberate; whole-stack/cross-row reorder paradigm-deferred); **B3** `caretBlockPos` folded onto `blockAncestor`; **B4** no action. Full record in the design doc "Known gaps" + [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md). Suite: **145 e2e + 721 app unit** green.

## Current focus

**MOST RECENT: strict-grid (above).** Prior active arc: **editor-refinement-pass** ([docs/design/editor-refinement-pass.md](docs/design/editor-refinement-pass.md) — cross-block feedback list, rulings, 4-group sequencing) building on the slice-6 Notion-hybrid arc ([notion-hybrid-editor.md](docs/design/notion-hybrid-editor.md) — stages 0–7 shipped). App/editor-only. All committed on `main`, **NOT pushed** (author pushes). Harness: **145 e2e + 721 app unit** green (`pnpm --filter @activity/app test:e2e`); lint 0 errors, 12 accepted warnings (`react-refresh` + `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`).

**Open remainders (deferred), roughly in priority order:**
1. **Focus mode** (slice-6 stage 7 split it out) — the dim-the-rest toggle needs a caret-tracking ProseMirror plugin (CSS can't identify the caret block under one contenteditable — the same wall that deferred stage-1 gutter focus-parity); off-by-default, wants its own design+eng pass.
2. **Input-parity / a11y touch pass** — deferred from slice-6 stage 1 (touch needs a real device; `/` covers the keyboard floor).
3. **Slice 6.5 smart-defaults** — net-new unvalidated heuristics; own spike, gates nothing.
4. **⌘⇧↑/↓ keyboard-reorder settle** — snap-motion follow-up (debounce design).
5. **Chip open:** the slash menu dies under synthetic keyboard input once a query char follows `/` (clean-tree repro; humans unaffected — e2e routes via the Add-a-block modal). **Papercut:** the gutter "+" (BlockAddButtonHost) can overlap the drag grip's lower half on a short block.

**Verification quirk:** the in-app Browser pane suppresses the position-measured hosts (command bar / quick-bar / drawer) under JS-driven selection — Playwright e2e (real chromium) is authoritative; drive the drawer via node-selection + gear + Advanced. `/playground` (unauthed) is the dev target; `/playground?empty=1` mounts a blank doc.

Completed session narratives (graph-authoring redirection, Groups 1–4, slice-6 stages 0–7, dark mode, image crop, graph systems, math blanks, the deploy trains) are archived in [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md) (2026-07-15 → 07-21 section).

---

_Backlog / candidate arcs (columns slices 1–5, strict-grid, and slice-6 stages 0–7 are all DONE; completed narratives in [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md); durable reasoning in [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md); current per-feature status is the table below):_

- **▶ SCHEDULED — runtime budget-ladder: per-question-type inlining variants (do BEFORE the next question-type generation).** The base runtime is **41.8 KiB, over its 40 KiB soft target** (the math-blank runtime pushed it over); the 2026-07-10 amendment ([DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) → "Runtime size budget amendment") says pull a structural lever when a variant nears the ceiling, "scheduled, not discovered." This is that lever. **Mechanism already exists:** [document.ts](packages/renderer/src/document.ts) picks the runtime by scanning the rendered `body` for marker attributes — a base-vs-graphs ternary plus four marker-keyed sidecars (reference-panel / definitions / calculator / feedback), each inlined only when its marker is present. **Approach:** carve the less-common question machinery out of the always-on base into the same conditionally-inlined-chunk pattern, keyed by block-marker attributes, leaving a minimal always-on core (text/numeric blanks + MC + checkpoints/persistence/submission). Split candidates, heaviest/least-common first: free-text (`self_explanation`/`short_answer`/`essay`, `.free-text-input`), `matching`, `ordering`, and the math-blank strategy glue. **Constraints that make this non-trivial (eng-review at pickup):** the runtime invariants must survive the split — `init.ts` is the ONLY DOM walker, `render()` is the ONLY DOM mutator, scoring/strategies register once; the split chunks stay vanilla-TS concatenated like the sidecars (NO `@activity/schema` import, no JS deps); `scripts/bundle-renderer.mjs` grows a chunk-emit step; re-measure every variant against the ladder (target/ceiling) after. **Not blocking today** (no new question-type is queued), but it must land before one does. Wants `/plan-eng-review` (variant taxonomy + walker/registration seams) before build.
- **Free activity catalog / "Activity Bank"** (Phase 2 cold-start lever; browse + run/assign/print; [free-activity-catalog.md](docs/design/free-activity-catalog.md)). Design-reconciliation DONE + 6/7 decisions author-ruled 2026-07-13 (`visibility='public'`=listed, definer-RPC catalog surface, signed-in audience v1, published-version-only print, own route; multi-author-ready per ruling #1). **One open item: #6 taxonomy/tags — author wants a tags discussion at kickoff** (lean `tags text[]` + GIN). Design-only until pickup.
- **Vocabulary glossary — Phase 4** (tenant-scoped `glossary_entry` store + `glossaryKey` resolution at publish; light implicit-reuse + suggest-don't-apply auto-suggest; both additive to the shipped mark; [vocabulary-definitions.md](docs/design/vocabulary-definitions.md)).
- **Long-term OCR/AI (design captured 2026-06-16, not scheduled):** PDF → activity import ([pdf-import.md](docs/design/pdf-import.md)) + photo-upload answer checking ([photo-grading.md](docs/design/photo-grading.md)). Decisions locked (generic-master QR, teacher-grading-aid v1, transcription-only). Photo-grading needs one refactor: server-shareable answer evaluation.
- **Phase 1 polish:** custom domain for R2.
- **Other Phase 2 "decide at phase start":** image-hosting quota, `skills` editing UI (block-type priority is COMPLETE — all four pedagogical blocks shipped).

| Migration 0009 (security/performance housekeeping) | ✅ Applied + fully verified 2026-07-11 (8-step MCP verification passed; advisor residue is intentional — see DECISIONS) |
| ```numberline``` + ```dataplot``` markdown import fences | ✅ Committed 2026-07-12, app-only; reach teachers via the SPA deploy (main pushed) |
| Pedagogical blocks — `learning_objectives`, `worked_example`, `faded_worked_example`, `self_explanation` | ✅ DEPLOYED 2026-07-12 (train author-run: ingest v9 then publish). Browser-verified on `/playground`. First three are content/scaffold (no wire bump); self-explanation is ungraded free text (wire v8→v9 `freeResponses`, storage v9→v10, new runtime module + RUNTIME.md contract + dashboard). **Markdown import shipped**: ` ```objectives / ```worked / ```faded / ```explain ` fences (app-only, rides SPA deploy). Nice-to-have author eyeballs: `{{}}`-in-faded-step keystroke, live self-explanation submit→dashboard round-trip |
| Phase 2.6 manual grading (short_answer + essay + rubrics + grading) | ✅ Code complete (slices 1–5) + **DEPLOYED + live-verified** 2026-07-13. Migrations 0010+0011 applied; `get-feedback` (`verify_jwt:false`) + `publish-activity` deployed; anonymous get-feedback gate confirmed open, advisor clean. In-document rubrics; `grades` table + RLS + direct upsert; teacher grading UI (side-by-side + Needs-grading filter); student feedback via `get-feedback` + a conditional sidecar (base runtime 39.2 KiB). **Markdown import: ` ```shortanswer ` + ` ```essay ` fences added 2026-07-13** (rubric pipe grammar + essay `words:` range; app-only, `/playground`-verified). Only a human app-level round-trip smoke test remains |

Suite now (2026-07-21): schema 321 / graph-kit 370 / renderer 651 / app 721 unit + 145 e2e; typecheck + lint green (0 errors; pre-existing warnings only). The ```shortanswer/```essay import fences added 25 app tests. The four pedagogical blocks + import fences + Phase 2.6 short_answer/essay/rubrics added ~82 tests across the packages (incl. a runtime `init.test.ts` case proving a `fill_in_blank` NESTED in a `faded_worked_example` is discovered by `buildRefs`, and a jsdom `free-text.test.ts` for free-text capture/gather/persist + the essay word counter). `runtime-doc-contract.test.ts` classifies the pedagogical trio as CONTAINER and the three free-text types (`self_explanation` / `short_answer` / `essay`) as INTERACTIVE (their shared RUNTIME.md contract section is guard-enforced). Runtime bundle **base 41.8 KiB / graphs 49.1 KiB** minified (+ a 1.7 KiB feedback sidecar inlined only on gradable pages) (re-check with `pnpm bundle:renderer`; treat printed numbers as truth). **Both variants are now over the 40 KiB soft target** — under the 60 ceiling, accepted per the 2026-07-10 budget amendment (DECISIONS.md → "Runtime size budget amendment"). **Base has crossed its soft target** (the math-blank runtime landed on it) — the budget-ladder lever (per-question-type inlining variants) is now **SCHEDULED as the top backlog item** (see "Backlog / candidate arcs" above), to land before the next question-type generation. The graph-runtime-into-kit lever was pulled 2026-07-10 — graph work grows the cached kit, not the inline bundles. (Environment note: this machine is the 2026-07-04 recovery clone — old computer died; toolchain re-set-up verified by a full green run. Kit-upload creds live in a gitignored `.env.r2`, auto-loaded by `pnpm upload:graph-kit` — the upload is an explicit command; `pnpm build:graph-kit` is build-only and never touches R2; see `.env.r2.example`.)

## Key constants

- **GitHub repo:** `ZanReed/activity-platform`
- **Supabase project ref:** `dtqutpdplefmufrrakxs`
- **Storage bucket (legacy):** `activities` — deleted 2026-06-18 after R2 verified end-to-end (note: the app's `.from('activities')` calls are the DB table, not this bucket)
- **Auth:** Google OAuth via Supabase. Site URL `http://localhost:5173` for dev. Allowlist-only signup (Phase 1).
- **Client env:** `VITE_PUBLISHED_URL_BASE` in `.env.local` (gitignored) mirrors the write-only `R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE` secret; unset → published-page links hide.

## Open questions / deferred decisions

- **Custom domain for R2** (Phase 2 polish): `pub-<hash>.r2.dev` → `activities.<brand>.com` once a domain is owned; ~5 min of Cloudflare DNS after that.
- **Empty fill_in_blank drag handle attachment** — whether `definingForContent: true` changed the handles-only-on-non-empty behavior is unverified; re-test during a drag-reorder pass. Minor.
- **Blank popover: one-click switch between chips** — deferred design decision, no data loss; full reasoning in [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) → "Fill-in-blank authoring (Stage 13.5)". Needs a dedicated design pass (FocusTrap/selection entanglement).
- **Section metadata panel** — SectionBreakView's inline title/checkpoint UI is adequate for now; an editor-level panel remains optional.
- **Responsive `--blank-width` sizing** — deferred from Stage 11.
- **Phase 2 block-type priority order** (worked example, faded worked example, learning objectives, self-explanation) — decide when Phase 2 starts.
- **`skills` editing UI** — deferred to Phase 2 per schema scheduling; the field round-trips everywhere, only the editing control is missing. Don't add piecemeal without the per-skill-analytics scope.
- **UX validation with 2–3 other teachers** on the editor patterns before classroom adoption — cost rises sharply once students use activities.
- **Post-success edit edge case** — locked/single paths briefly write-then-remove the persistence blob (wasteful but correct). Low priority.
- **CDN-hosted shared runtime** (Phase 3+): trigger is when republishing for runtime bug fixes gets painful (~50+ active activities).
- **Multi-tenancy / governance when a teacher leaves a district** — Phase 4; helpers are designed for it.
- **Manual grading workflow shape** (Phase 2.6), **media storage/privacy posture** (Phase 2.8), **annotation coordinate space** (Phase 2.9) — each decided at its phase start.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-21 (**Editor arc: stage 6 (snap motion) + stage 7 (toolbar-diet cleanup) SHIPPED; focus mode deferred.** Stage 6 = settle-on-place + accent dropcursor + reduced-motion sweep (13 unit + 7 e2e; eng-reviewed, outside voice reversed the detection mechanism to explicit meta-tagging). Stage 7 = removed the last inline control duplicating a settings field (faded-example "Label steps" toggle); block-style picker + column cluster kept in the toolbar (author call); focus mode deferred to its own mini-arc (needs a caret-tracking plugin). Also **greened the whole e2e suite** — fixed 5 stale gutter/quickbar/select-state tests from the right-gutter rework (127 e2e passed). Noted a minor real papercut: the gutter "+" can overlap the drag grip on short blocks. Chip open: slash menu dies under synthetic keyboard input. Full records in the deferred-remainders list above + [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md). **Prior sessions (2026-07-13 → 07-20)** — Model A/B math blanks (build + deploy trains + owner eyeballs), dark mode + graph-kit color pass, image crop mode, the columns→strict-grid refactor, the Notion-hybrid editor stages 0–7, and the number_line/data_plot/pedagogical-block trains — **are archived in [HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md)**.)
