# STATE.md

A living "where am I" snapshot. Update at the end of each work session — replace the relevant sections, don't append. Keep it under ~150 lines: move finished-work narratives to [docs/HISTORY.md](docs/HISTORY.md), durable reasoning to [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Project rules live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Pending author actions

Things only the author does (pushes, deploys, migrations), queued and waiting:

1. **Reminder:** any future redeploy of `ingest-submission` needs `--no-verify-jwt` (see CLAUDE.md).
2. **After the e2e pass verifies R2 end-to-end:** delete the legacy Supabase Storage `activities` bucket and any env vars referencing it.

Cleared 2026-06-17: **migration `0008_soft_delete_activity.sql` deployed — deleting activities now works** (soft-delete RLS bug; writeup in HISTORY 2026-06-17, reasoning in DECISIONS → "Activity deletion"). Cleared 2026-06-16: **cross-origin `<img>` loads from R2 confirmed working** by the author; **the three real-mouse GUI passes confirmed working** (drag-between-cells, image resize handles, nested rich-text mini-editor). Also: `publish-activity` redeployed with the **submission-payload fix** (runtime now POSTs snake_case `activity_id`/`display_name` matching `ingest-submission`) and the `[TEST] E2E Coverage` activity re-published — live submit verified end to end (see Current focus). Cleared 2026-06-13 (verified via Supabase API): `publish-activity` was at **v34**, carrying the full variable-block-sizing bundle (width fill + image fixed-height crop + cell `--cell-min-height`). Earlier (2026-06-12): migration 0007 applied; `upload-image` deployed; `ingest-submission` still has `verify_jwt: false`.

## Current focus

**▶ No active goal — next focus is open.** Pick from "Also queued" below.

Recently completed (newest first; durable detail in [DECISIONS](docs/DECISIONS.md)/[HISTORY](docs/HISTORY.md)):

- **Markdown import — COMPLETE** (2026-06-16/17) — paste-markdown → editor blocks. Standalone converter [`lib/markdownToTiptap.ts`](packages/app/src/lib/markdownToTiptap.ts) (markdown-it, lazy-loaded + vanilla) + a header **Import dialog** (live block/problem summary, warnings, **Copy AI prompt**). Covers headings, paragraphs, bold/italic/code, nested lists, blanks→`fillInBlank`, `{checkpoint}`→checkpoint section break, `$…$`/`$$…$$` math, `![alt](url)` images; a blank-bearing list flattens to one problem per item; unsupported input degrades to text + warning. Blanks/`{checkpoint}` resolved in the mapper; **math lifted from raw source before markdown-it** so LaTeX backslashes survive CommonMark escaping. **App-only/additive — no schema/renderer/runtime change, no bundle, no deploy.** Also shipped: the [agent-facing format spec](docs/markdown-import-format.md) + canonical prompt (model wraps output in a fence so it's copyable; importer unwraps an outer fence), a **drift guard** binding prompt↔doc↔converter, a **StrictMode RTL regression test** for the dialog, and a hardened editor-instance lift. 69 markdown-import tests; verified against the live ProseMirror schema on `/playground`. Full reasoning in DECISIONS → "Markdown import".
- **End-to-end submit path verified + bug fixed** (2026-06-16) — first real live-network submit found the runtime POSTing camelCase (`activityId`/`displayName`) while `ingest-submission` requires snake_case (`activity_id`/`display_name`) → `400 activity_id is required`. Fixed: runtime now sends snake_case (canonical — matches DB columns + RPC), payload assembly extracted to a pure, unit-tested `buildSubmissionPayload`; bundle regenerated; `publish-activity` redeployed + activity re-published. Verified the submission row in the DB: `display_name`, `score 0.75`, `attempt_number 1`, `schemaVersion 2`, 4 blanks, 2 checkpoint sections, per-blank confidence all landed. Seed bed: `scripts/seed-e2e-activity.sql`. Remaining e2e bits not yet exercised: the **locked-mode** pass (inputs freeze after check) and the in-app **Submissions dashboard** view.
- **Deferred test coverage** (2026-06-13) — `init.test.ts` now covers `state.blanks`/`state.blocks` (one defaulted entry per ref, empty when none). The blank-edit popover's draft/commit/close decisions were extracted to a pure `blankPopoverLogic.ts` (behavior-preserving lift out of `BlankEditPopover`/`BlankPopoverHost`) and unit-tested (`blankPopoverLogic.test.ts`, 25 cases — `computeFlush`, `resolveAnswerBlur`, `resolveAcceptableCommit`, `filterFeedbackForCommit`, `isSameBlankSelection`). Refactor browser-smoke-verified: edit commits on outside-click close, whitespace stripped, selection released.
- **Foldable × columns verification** (2026-06-13) — a top-level columns container flows whole through the foldable, never splits, `fr` tracks resolve against the fixed panel width. Tests + dev-only `/dev/foldable-columns` bench. DECISIONS → "Structural columns + variable block sizing".
- **CI + housekeeping** (2026-06-13) — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (typecheck → lint → test → build → bundle-staleness guard, on push + PR); app `typecheck` + root `lint` scripts; `packageManager: pnpm@11.1.2` pin; pre-existing lint errors cleared (now 0 errors / 2 intentional warnings).
- **Variable block sizing** (2026-06-12/13) — COMPLETE + deployed (publish-activity v34). DECISIONS → "Structural columns + variable block sizing"; design in [docs/design/variable-block-sizing.md](docs/design/variable-block-sizing.md).

Standing follow-up: none — the image resize drag-handles + the other real-mouse GUI passes were confirmed working by the author (2026-06-16).

Also queued:

- **End-to-end manual test** — ▶ free-mode submit path DONE 2026-06-16 (found + fixed the snake_case payload bug; DB row verified). **Still to run:** the **locked-mode** pass (re-publish in locked mode → inputs freeze after check) and the in-app **Submissions dashboard** view. (Full checklist preserved in docs/HISTORY.md.)
- **Phase 1 polish:** custom domain for R2.
- **Free activity catalog (design captured 2026-06-16, target Phase 2):** public catalog of free first-party math activities a newcomer can run as-is — a cold-start lever pairing with self-signup ([docs/design/free-activity-catalog.md](docs/design/free-activity-catalog.md)). The Phase 5 marketplace's free/discovery slice pulled forward; "use" = run-in-place read-only (not clone-to-edit). Phase 2 slice = browse + run/assign/print; consumer submission dashboards depend on Phase 3 assignment scoping.
- **Long-term OCR/AI features (design captured 2026-06-16, not scheduled):** PDF → activity import ([docs/design/pdf-import.md](docs/design/pdf-import.md)) and photo-upload answer checking ([docs/design/photo-grading.md](docs/design/photo-grading.md)). Both reuse existing pipelines (markdown-paste DSL converter; the submission pipeline); decisions locked: generic-master QR, teacher-grading-aid v1, transcription-only AI rule. Photo-grading flags one real refactor — make answer evaluation server-shareable.
- **Housekeeping (remaining):** CI runs on every branch (no branch filter) — narrow to `main` + PRs if the noise warrants. The deferred-test items (`init.test.ts` state coverage, popover state-machine) both landed 2026-06-13.

## Key constants

- **GitHub repo:** `ZanReed/activity-platform`
- **Supabase project ref:** `dtqutpdplefmufrrakxs`
- **Storage bucket (legacy):** `activities` (public; delete after R2 migration verified)
- **Auth:** Google OAuth via Supabase. Site URL `http://localhost:5173` for dev. Allowlist-only signup (Phase 1).
- **Client env:** `VITE_PUBLISHED_URL_BASE` in `.env.local` (gitignored) mirrors the write-only `R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE` secret; unset → published-page links hide.

## Open questions / deferred decisions

- **Custom domain for R2** (Phase 2 polish): `pub-<hash>.r2.dev` → `activities.<brand>.com` once a domain is owned; ~5 min of Cloudflare DNS after that.
- **Empty fill_in_blank drag handle attachment** — whether `definingForContent: true` changed the handles-only-on-non-empty behavior is unverified; re-test during a drag-reorder pass. Minor.
- **Blank popover: one-click switch between chips** — deferred design decision, no data loss; full reasoning in [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) → "Fill-in-blank authoring (Stage 13.5)". Needs a dedicated design pass (FocusTrap/selection entanglement).
- **Section metadata panel** — SectionBreakView's inline title/checkpoint UI is adequate for now; an editor-level panel remains optional.
- **Responsive `--blank-width` sizing** — deferred from Stage 11.
- **Phase 2 block-type priority order** (worked example, faded worked example, learning objectives, self-explanation) — decide when Phase 2 starts.
- **`skills` editing UI** — deferred to Phase 2 per schema scheduling; the field round-trips everywhere, only the editing control is missing. Don't add piecemeal without the per-skill-analytics scope.
- **UX validation with 2–3 other teachers** on the editor patterns before classroom adoption — cost rises sharply once students use activities.
- **Post-success edit edge case** — locked/single paths briefly write-then-remove the persistence blob (wasteful but correct). Low priority.
- **CDN-hosted shared runtime** (Phase 3+): trigger is when republishing for runtime bug fixes gets painful (~50+ active activities).
- **Multi-tenancy / governance when a teacher leaves a district** — Phase 4; helpers are designed for it.
- **Manual grading workflow shape** (Phase 2.6), **media storage/privacy posture** (Phase 2.8), **annotation coordinate space** (Phase 2.9) — each decided at its phase start.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-17. Recent sessions (durable reasoning in DECISIONS → "Markdown import"):

- **Markdown import — complete + hardened.** Full arc on `main`: core (headings/paragraphs/marks/nested lists/`{{blanks}}`→`fillInBlank`/`{checkpoint}`→section breaks), math + images (`$…$`/`$$…$$` lifted from raw source so LaTeX backslashes survive; `![](url)` lifted into image blocks), the agent-facing format spec + **Copy AI prompt** button, a drift guard binding prompt↔doc↔converter, and a StrictMode RTL regression test for the dialog. App-only/additive — no schema/renderer/runtime change, no bundle, no deploy. Verified against the live ProseMirror schema on `/playground` (math KaTeX-renders, images carry src+alt).
- **Two bug fixes from real-use reports.** (1) Dialog vanished on open — FocusTrap `onDeactivate: onClose` fires on StrictMode's dev double-unmount; close now driven only by Escape + backdrop handlers (regression-tested). (2) A reported *disabled* Import button traced to a stale dev server; hardened the editor-instance lift (`onEditorReady`) to report only a non-null editor and never null on cleanup, so it can't stick disabled. **Author confirmed the dialog now opens.**
- **AI prompt fences its output.** LLMs render markdown in chat (uncopyable); the prompt now tells the model to wrap its whole reply in a code fence (chat shows a Copy button → raw markdown). The importer also unwraps a whole-paste ```` ```markdown ```` fence as a safety net.
- **End-to-end verified (2026-06-17):** author ran multiple manual smoke tests in the real `ActivityEditor` route — import persists across reload, appends to existing content (doesn't replace), and published pages render imported math/blanks. No gaps remaining.
- **Earlier (2026-06-16):** delete activities (RLS soft-delete); E2E free-mode submit verified + snake_case payload bug fixed (DB row confirmed); flush-leak investigated → no data loss. Detail in "Recently completed" above.
- Suite: schema 54 / renderer 254 / app 227; CI green. `main` carries the markdown-import arc ahead of `origin/main` (close-out commits unpushed — author pushes).
